So here it is. Our first app that is (almost) complete. It's called [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock/).

Tock is a textual clock app. Rather than having a clock on your desk or beside your bed, just plug in your iPhone or iPad and turn on Tock. It will be the most attractive clock you'll have as it displays the time and date and includes beautiful animations as the time ticks by.

Tock will be in the App Store soon for both iPhone and iPad. Check back for more updates or subscribe to our blog to stay informed.

What are your thoughts on Tock? Love it? Hate it? Have any suggestions? We want to hear it all in the comments below.
