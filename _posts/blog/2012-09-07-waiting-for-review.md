Well, the day has finally arrived. There were definitely times when I didn't think it would happen. But tonight, I've submitted my first ever app for public release. You heard it here first. [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock/) is done... at least as far as an app is ever "done".

By that, I mean that once Tock is approved by the all-knowing reviewers at Apple, it will be available for download. But that doesn't mean that I won't try to continue improving it. Public release is really only the first part of it all. Then I will be able to start using data and input from users to fix bugs, add features, and make Tock the best that it can be.

But maybe I am getting a little ahead of myself. The app is not approved yet and there are lots of horror stories about Apple's approval process. But I'm still feeling pretty good about it all. I mean, what's not to feel good about? I just [introduced]({{ site.baseurl }}/2012/09/introducing-tock/) the app a few short days ago. Thanks to some wonderful testers, we've tested the app on a number of devices and now we're ready for the big time.

So here's hoping everything goes well, and I'll be able to report a successful entrance into the App Store within a week or so.
