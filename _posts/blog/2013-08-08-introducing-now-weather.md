Today, I'm happy to introduce our newest app, [NOW Weather]({{ site.baseurl }}/now-weather/), a beautiful app showing all the weather information you care about, at a glance.

I know, I know... there's about a billion weather apps already available for iPhones. What makes this one so different?

Well let's first ask the question, when do you look up the weather on your phone? Are you doing absolutely nothing else besides looking at the weather? I doubt it. We don't use our phones that way. A weather app is usually used while getting ready in the morning, or making plans with your friends. You don't want to have to hunt through a complex weather app to find the simple information you care about. That just makes the process longer and more irritating.

Alternatively, have you downloaded a weather app that looks absolutely beautiful, but is so minimal that you can't even find everything you're looking for? What's the point of good aesthetics if the app is useless?

NOW Weather is the answer to these two alternatives. It makes the information extremely accessible and easy to find. You can just glance down and the colors will indicate the temperature for the next few hours along with whether it will be sunny, cloudy, rainy, or whatever.

But along with that, you'll have whatever other information you want as well. Hourly forecasts show the chance of precipitation and projected snow accumulations. You can see the weather at any location on Earth. And soon you'll be able to get more detail about the weather right now (wind, humidity, etc.) as well as the weather for the days ahead.

[NOW Weather]({{ site.baseurl }}/now-weather/) is exactly what you are looking for in a weather app. Give it a shot to replace your current weather app, and you won't look back.
