After having so much fun creating and releasing [my first open source Jekyll theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes), I figured I'd go at it again. So here be the fruit of that effort --- I call it [**So Simple Theme**](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme), a responsive Jekyll theme for words and photos. 

## So Simple Theme is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers. 
* Minimal embellishments and subtle animations. 
* Readable typography to make your words shine.
* Support for large images to call out your favorite posts.
* Disqus comments if you choose to enable.
* Simple and clear permalink structure[^1].
* Tags for [Open Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) for a better social sharing experience.

## Getting started

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [So Simple Theme repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme/)
3. Make it your own and customize, customize, customize.

**Like this theme?** I just released my third theme for Jekyll, with a sweet animated drop down menu, social sharing plugins, and a Grunt build script for theme development. I'm calling it HPSTER Theme and you can [learn more about it here]({{ site.baseurl }}/articles/hpstr-jekyll-theme.html).
