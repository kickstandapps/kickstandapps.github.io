As wonderful as we think [NOW Weather]({{ site.baseurl }}/now-weather/) is, we fully realize that not everyone has a need for a paid weather app. But since we truly think that everyone would enjoy the work we've put into it, we've decided to release another version at the low, low cost of... free.

[NOW Weather Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/now-weather-free/id829424312?ls=1&mt=8) provides the same beautiful view of the weather as the original app. Even with all the weather apps on the market, NOW Weather takes a different approach than anyone else. It's an approach we've worked hard to craft into what we think is the best and quickest way to view the upcoming weather.

Before you ask, yes, NOW Weather Free is ad-supported. It's taken a lot of hard work and many, many hours to create NOW Weather, and by including ads, we're able to continue supporting ourselves and all the future work we plan on achieving. We feel that we've implemented the ads so that they are least intrusive on the experience we've intended. 

However, if the advertisements really bother you, we encourage you to spend the minimal charge to purchase the full version of NOW Weather. Not only will this remove the ads, but it will also provide a full 7-day forecast. It will also be the version that recieves any new feature as soon as it's available.

We encourage everyone to check out [NOW Weather Free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/now-weather-free/id829424312?ls=1&mt=8). It costs no money and minimal time. There's no excuse not to give it a shot.
