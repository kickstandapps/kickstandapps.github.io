Jekyll is pretty rad and figured releasing a cleaned up version of [my site](http://mademistakes.com) as a theme for others to hack and build on would be fun. So here be that theme --- I call it **[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes)**, a responsive Jekyll theme with editorial tendencies. 

## Minimal Mistakes is all about:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments. Content first; other widget nonsense never.
* Large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
* Stylesheets for Pygments and Coderay [syntax highlighting](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/articles/code-highlighting-post/) to make your code examples look snazzy.
* Simple and clean permalink structure[^1].

## Basic Setup

1. [Install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) if you haven't already.
2. Fork the [Minimal Mistakes repo](http://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/)
3. Clone the repo you just forked to your computer.
4. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
5. Check out the sample posts in `_posts` to see examples for pulling in large feature images, tags, and other YAML data.
6. Read the documentation below for further customization pointers and documentation.

**ProTip:** Delete the `gh-pages` branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off `master`. There is a bunch of garbage in `gh-pages` used for the theme's demo site that I'm guessing you don't want on your site.
