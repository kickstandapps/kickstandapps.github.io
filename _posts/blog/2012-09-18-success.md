I am extremely happy to announce that [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock) is now in the App Store.

After [submitting]({{ site.baseurl }}/2012/09/waiting-for-review/) it for approval just 10 days ago, I got the good news today that it was approved. I've heard a lot of horror stories about apps being delayed and rejected multiple times because of small details. It feels really good to know that Tock went through that same scrutiny and came out the other side without a scratch.

This is because Tock is just a great, straight-forward app. It re-imagines the task of telling time into something unique. Time is fluid, and Tock displays that in a way that no other app does. It looks great sitting at your desk while you work or sitting by your bed while you sleep.

So please check it out. It's available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tock/id560678443?ls=1&amp;mt=8) for both iPhone and iPad for just 99¢. Let us know what you think. Now that the first version is out in the wild, it's time to start working on the improvements!
