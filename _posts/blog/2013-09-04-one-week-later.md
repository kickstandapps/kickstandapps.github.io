Last Wednesday I released [NOW Weather]({{ site.baseurl }}/now-weather/). It has been an interesting seven days since then. This is the first time that I've really tried to get an audience to see what I've been working on. This post will just detail a few of the things I tried, and the results I've seen.

##What we tried
Up until now, the only places I've posted links have been social networks. This hasn't generated a lot of response. Makes sense though. As of writing this we have only one follower on Twitter, eight followers on Facebook, and just about nothing to speak of on LinkedIn and Google+.

So, it seemed like it was time to try something new. I decided about a month ago that I was going to try to do better at promoting the launch of NOW Weather than I did promoting [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock/) when it launched last year. So I set up a [landing page]({{ site.baseurl }}/now-weather/) with some promotional images, some details, and an email subscription. Then I wrote up a [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }})/2013/08/introducing-now-weather/)introducing the app. I posted the link to the standard social networks, but I also tried submitting the link to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). If you're not familiar with Hacker News, it's just a community of people interested in new technology, design, and startups. Anyone can submit a link, and it gets voted up by readers. If you get enough votes, you make the front page of the site and have your link seen by thousands of people.

However, this first try didn't get seen by thousands of people. Over the next few days, the site got about 88 page views. Not exactly setting the world on fire. Even worse, not a single person subscribed for updates. Oh well.

So we went ahead with getting the app ready for launch, submitting it to Apple, and having it approved. So I figured I'd give this all another shot on launch day. I wrote up another [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }})/2013/08/introducing-now-weather/). I posted it to those same old social networks. I also posted it to the [Side Project subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/) hoping for some interest from an audience looking for these types of projects. Finally I posted again to Hacker News.

This time fared quite a bit better. The post got some early upvotes and made it on to the front page of Hacker News for an hour or two. This brought in many, many more people than ever before. By the end of the day, there were 2220 page views. It definitely won't set any internet records, but for us it was impressive. More encouraging was the 193 clicks on the link taking people to NOW Weather in the App Store. This spike in viewers obviously didn't last, though. The following day had about 100 page views and the days that followed were between 10 and 20 from links still floating around.

##What it meant
So did all of this traffic lead to a huge influx of cash from all the apps we sold?

In a word, no.

But for us, we still did pretty well. At least in comparison to app sales for [Tock]({{ site.baseurl }}/tock/). We managed 18 apps sold on launch day. Followed by days of 9 and 4 before settling at about one per day. We've also managed a few sales of Tock as well. So not a terrible first week, at least by our expectations.

##What we learned
But, just because I'm not a millionaire over night doesn't mean I didn't learn something from the experience. I got a large number of people interested enough to get to our site. Some of them even poked around for a while. However, we just weren't able to turn those visitors into customers.

But I think I have an idea that could help. Is it possible that most people don't want to pay for a weather app, no matter how nicely done, when there are many free options available? Absolutely, and I'm sure that many people would have ultimately chosen not to buy no matter what I did differently. However, I think the biggest problem was that I surprised them. Nowhere in either the product page or blog post did I mention price. My guess is that this led many people to believe the app would be free. When they clicked the link and saw a $1.99 price tag, they were surprised and didn't buy. If I had clearly communicated the cost initially, everyone would have had a chance to determine whether they would spend the money before clicking the link. It would have definitely meant fewer clicks, but a much higher percentage would have gone through with the purchase. From now on, all my promotional pages will have a clearly indicated price to avoid this confusion.

The other regret I have is that I had two thousand people looking at my site, and I don't have a single piece of information to target them for future products or updates. I removed my subscription box when the app was ready to go. If even a small number of viewers would have subscribed, I would have that much of a head start on an audience for future projects and posts. So now I've got a subscription box in the side bar of the blog posts to hopefully avoid this again.

##Recap
So, all in all, I'm happy with the launch that we had last week. It didn't surpass our wildest dreams, but it showed me that I'm on the right track towards getting an audience and successfully marketing our products. I can learn from the missteps and missed opportunities and do better next time, and that's what I'm going to do.
