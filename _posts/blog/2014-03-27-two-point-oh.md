[NOW Weather]({{ site.baseurl }}/now-weather/) has been for sale since August without any updates. Well, it's time that changed. We're proud to announce that we've released version 2.0 of NOW Weather.

What's new? Well, all the features that you've enjoyed so far stick around. There's no earth-shattering interface changes. But we've added a feature that we're really excited about.

The point of NOW Weather all along was to give you the weather information you actually care about. That started with a beautiful, visual way to identify what the weather was going to do in the coming hours. The next logical step is to look further into the future.

So, we're happy to introduce 7-Day Forecasts to NOW Weather. Just swipe from right to left to take a look at the week ahead. The information shown includes daily highs and lows, chance and type of precipitation, and expected snow accumulation when necessary (here's hoping there's no more snow).

So please enjoy the new update. If you appreciate the addition, be sure to write a review of the app. It takes just a couple minutes of your time, but it goes a long way to spreading the word about NOW Weather. And as a small company, the more people downloading the app, the more updates and attention it will receive.

Finally, I'd like to take the chance to thank everyone who has already purchased the app. What may be a small act to you is what allows us to do what we enjoy, create apps.
