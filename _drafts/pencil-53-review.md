For the last month I've had the privilege of wielding a beta version of FiftyThree's [first hardware product](http://fiftythree.com/pencil), Pencil[^pencil-beta]. A Bluetooth stylus that works exclusively with Paper and an iPad, and delivers an experience other styluses have failed to match. 

[^pencil-beta]: The Pencil units I've tested are both in beta along with the Paper app. Some features like Blend and palm rejection are actively being developed and might differ slightly from how I described them here.

## Look and Feel

For starters both the Walnut and Graphite finishes look beautiful and feel amazing in your hands. If pressed to pick a favorite, I would probably choose Graphite, just because it feels heavier and more solid to me. But there is something nostalgic and comforting about Walnut's wood texture that makes it a close second in my book.

If you haven't noticed, Pencil is flat like a [carpenter's pencil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpenter_pencil), which means it will stay put on a desk and not roll around. Originally I noticed a slight discomfort using Pencil during long drawing sessions, due to the flat shape (or maybe it's just how I hold it?). I'm sure most won't be bothered by it, but it's worth being aware of if you put in long hours with Paper.

Between the two finishes, Walnut is lighter and softer to the touch with a wood texture allowing for more grip. Graphite on the other hand feels slightly heavier and slicker with its brushed metal finish. Occasionally the smooth Graphite finish would cause Pencil to slip some in my hand requiring a grip adjustment --- but certainly not the end of the world.

Like Paper, Pencil is minimally designed --- that means no buttons, no LED lights[^led-light], and no switches. I love how the UI in Paper doesn't get in your way, and it's refreshing that Pencil's design echoes this theme. Freeing you up to create and do common things like erasing or blending, without having to open the tool tray or pressing a button. Want to erase something? Flip Pencil upside down and erase a mistake like you would "in real life." Need to soften pencil strokes? Use your finger to push the pixels around. 

[^led-light]: A LED light does exist, but it is not visible during normal use. When the battery is plugged into a USB port an orange light can be observed as it charges.

## Just the Tip

To be honest I was a little disappointed when I discovered Pencil's tip wouldn't be pressure sensitive. For someone who relies on a [Pogo Connect]({{ site.url }}/articles/pogo-connect-smart-pen.html) for the expressiveness it brings to Paper, switching to Pencil might be a hard sell. The good news is if none of that matters to you, Pencil is easily one of the better styluses I've used with Paper.

The tip is as responsive and accurate one can expect from a rubber tipped stylus. It is wedge shaped and offers a finer point than the rubber nubs found on Bamboos and its capacitive tipped peers. Earlier Pencil tips I tested would attract finger grease left on the iPad's screen and push it around --- slightly obscuring the drawing beneath. FiftyThree has since made design changes that have eliminated that phenomenon for me.

### Is the Tip Durable?

Let me start out by restating that the units I tested were in beta and these observations may not reflect the final product. The tip's on my first Pencil beta unit lasted anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour of drawing. Around this time I observed holes forming in the rubber, which caused black streaks to appear on the screen.

The tips were still completely usable and I could have pushed them more by rotating the pencil and using the other side of the tip, or just wiping the black streaks off the screen as I drew. The problem appears to be with the tip mechanism beneath the rubber. If you press too hard (which I tend to do) it will cause the rub to wear quicker.

The second unit I received was redesigned to be more durable and did fair much better in my tests. At around the 2--3 hours marks I observed a tare in the tip and less spring to the tip mechanism itself.

The fact that I was able to kill the tips so fast is a bit disappointing. Especially since I was able to draw everyday for 3--6 months with a LunaTik Touch or Pogo Connect without showing signs of wear. I'll be curious to see what others experience once Pencil is out in the wild. I have a feeling I picked up a nasty habit of pressing down hard due to an unresponsive[^unresponsive] Pogo Connect.

[^unresponsive]: Pogo Connect Smart Pen's with the new 1.1.0 firmware appear to lack responsiveness. I'm not sure if the firmware is to fault or if it's from solder job done to keep the tips from breaking off. I just know that I have to press a lot harder to get the pen to work how it used to, regardless if I fool around with the sensitivity controls in the [Pogo Connect iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pogo-connect/id566688179?mt=8).

One other thing I'd like to add about the tip. You can draw using the fatter sides of the tip. There is less friction here and should help to prolong the tip's life. Especially when used for coloring large areas that don't require detail work.

## Does it Blend?

For me Blend is the most exciting thing about Pencil. I can't tell you how pumped I was when I came across the feature in the instruction manual that shipped with my beta unit. FiftyThree is making refinements to how blend behaves so this might change slightly, but the basic idea is:

* You pair Pencil to Paper by *kissing* it to an icon in the lower left corner of the tool tray. 
* Once connected only Pencil can make marks on the canvas freeing up your fingers to blend. 
* Running your finger over a pencil line, a blob of watercolor, or a marker stroke, allows you to blend and blur them.

Sure a ton of *art* apps have smudging and blending tools, but they all break the creative flow. FiftyThree has made this valuable tool fun and more true to *real* drawing by allowing you to use your finger as the instrument of blending while continuing to draw with Pencil.

## What About the Eraser?

I'm not one for erasing and instead rely heavily on Rewind. But for those of you who do employ the eraser tool often, you're going to love Pencil. Instead of breaking the flow of drawing, stopping to open the tool tray, selecting the eraser, erasing your mistake, and flipping back to your drawing tool. Now you just flip Pencil on it's head and erase away. It's not any more precise than before, but it is way more convenient.

## Palm Resters Rejoice

Palm rejection has never been a concern of mine, but I know a lot of you have been looking for stylus that can do it well in Paper. I'm happy to say Pencil delivers. In my tests I had no issues drawing with my palms or hands resting on the iPad's screen. All of the expected gestures to zoom or rewind work just fine.

The only drawback I've noticed is you can't hide the tool tray or dismiss zoom directly with Pencil. You have to use your finger to do so, which I assume is a necessary concession because of how the iPad recognizes multi-touch inputs. I know the geniuses at FiftyThree are working hard to perfect palm rejection so stay tuned on this front.
